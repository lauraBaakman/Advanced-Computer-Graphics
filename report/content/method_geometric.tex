\subsection{Geometric component}
\label{ss:geometric_component}

As may become clear from the previous section, the only available information for the construction of the geometric component (and normal component) are the three vertices that define a single primitive. The vertices contain the vertex \textit{xyz} coordinates together with a unique normal per vertex i.e. the normals of each vertex is the same for every primitive using that vertex. Figure \ref{fig:method:input_primitive} contains an illustration of ``'the input primitive''
