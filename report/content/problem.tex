\section{Problem Definition}
\label{s:problem}

\todo[inline]{We have three subproblems, namely:}

\todo[inline]{1: Why use a fake normal field, the quadratic patch, if you can compute the normals of the vertices of the cubic patch.}

\future{2: Compare PN triangles with phong tesselation on the following aspects: performance, continuity, visual. We try to answer the question: When use PN when Phong?}

\todo[inline]{3: How does implementing PN triangles i the current OpenGL pipeline influence performance as compared to the performance on the CPU?}
