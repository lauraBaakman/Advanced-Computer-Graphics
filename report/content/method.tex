The main goal of point-normal triangles is to improve the visual quality of rendered models, especially on resource-limited hardware environments where e.g. no information about neighboring triangles can be accumulated. We ask the reader to have a look at \cref{fig:preamble:teaser}, with the following question in mind: Which rendering do you prefer? The center and right images both show a rendering using the phong shading and illumination model. The only difference being, that the right image is rendered using poit-normal triangles, with an inner and outer tessellation level of $12.0$. The influence of the tessellation levels is discussed in \crefs{s:implementation}. \citeauthor{vlachos2001curved} formulated the goal of point-normal triangles as: ``soften triangle creases and improve the visual appeal by generating smoother silhouettes and better shading". \citeauthor{vlachos2001curved} mention, besides the visual improvements, the following benefits of using PN triangles:

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
 	\item 
 		Point-normal triangle construction is \textit{compatible} with the existing graphics API data structures, i.e., vertex arrays together with triangle index streams, where the triangles arrive in unpredictable order.
 	\item 
 		The models are \textit{backward compatible} with hardware that does not support point-normal triangles, with minimal or no changes needed to existing models.
 	\item 
 		No setup of the application, API, or hardware driver is needed. Specifically, hardware is not required to provide random access to neighboring primitives. Consequently the only possible communicated information between primitives are provided by using shared normals at the vertices. This does restrict the models to be rendered somewhat, as discussed in \crefs{sss:method:geometry:properties}.
 	\item 
 		Point-normal triangles are applicable to meshes with \textit{arbitrary topology}.
 	\item 
 		PN-triangle rendering is \textit{fast} and done via \textit{simple implementation} in hardware on the CPU in 2001. At the time of writing point-normal triangles can be rendered via programmable tessellation shaders on the GPU.
 \end{enumerate} 

In the remaining part of this section we discuss the construction of point-normal triangles conceptually as well as mathematically. As mentioned in the introduction, a PN triangle is split in two different components: we refer to \crefs{ss:geometric_component} for a discussion on the geometric component and to \crefs{ss:normal_component} for the review of the normal component.

The input primitive consists of three vertices, $P_1$, $P_2$ and $P_3$, and three vertex normals, $N_1$, $N_2$, $N_3$. Note that only the information of a single primitive is used during the construction of both the geometric and the normal component, i.e. no information about neighboring primitives is used.}
