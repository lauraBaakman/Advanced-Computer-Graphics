\todo[inline]{Global idea of PN triangles, lit less global than in introduction}

PN triangles were designed to make models look better \todo{organics, visual performance}, but with the idea to not impact the graphics pipeline, as other more sophisticated methods (\todo{e.g. ...?} do. They are therefore a good alternative for resource-limited hardware environments where e.g. no information about neighboring triangles can be accumulated. Although the origin paper from \citeauthor{vlachos2001curved}\textcite{vlachos2001curved} was written in 2001, when there were no programmable tessellation shaders, the following given list ... bla bla bla

In section \ref{sec:implementation} we discuss the difference between the implementation of \citeauthor{vlachos2001curved} and implementation using the tessellation shaders.
