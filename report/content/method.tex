% \todo[inline]{Global idea of PN triangles, lit less global than in introduction}
The main goal of PN triangles is to improve the visual quality of rendered models, compare the models in \cref{fig:preamble:teaser}, and to do this on resource-limited hardware environments where e.g. no information about neighboring triangles can be accumulated. Or more precisely, the goal of point-normal triangles is ``to soften triangle creases and improve the visual appeal by generating smoother silhouettes and better shading" \cite{vlachos2001curved}. Other than the visual improvements PN triangles provide, \citeauthor{vlachos2001curved} mention the following benefits:

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
 	\item 
 		Point-normal triangle construction is \textit{compatible} with the existing API data structures i.e. vertex arrays together with triangle index streams are used, and the triangles arrive in an unpredictable order.
 	\item 
 		The models are \textit{backward compatible} with hardware that does not support point-normal triangles, with minimal or no changes needed to existing models.
 	\item 
 		\todo[inline]{API of what?}
 		No setup of the application, API, or hardware driver is needed. Specifically hardware should not be able to provide random access to neighboring primitives. Consequently the only possible communicated information between primitives are provided by using shared normals at the vertices. Which does restrict the models to be rendered somewhat, as discussed in section \ref{sss:method:geometric:properties}.
 	\item 
 		Point-normal triangles are applicable to \textit{arbitrary topology}.
 	\item 
 		PN-triangle rendering is done \textit{fast} and via \textit{simple implementation} in hardware on the CPU in 2001. At the time of writing this report even faster executing is possible by using programmable tessellation shaders on the GPU.
 \end{enumerate} 

In the remaining part of this section we discuss the construction of point-normal triangles conceptually as well as mathematically. As mentioned in the introduction, A PN triangle is split in two different components: we refer to section \ref{ss:geometric_component} for a discussion on the geometric component and to section \ref{ss:normal_component} for the review of the normal component.

	\caption{An input primitive as used by point-normal triangle consists of three vertices and three vertex normals. Note that only the information from a single primitive is used during the construction of both the geometric and the normal component. The labels of the vertices and normals coincide with those used in the equations in this section.}
